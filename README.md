## What is this?
This project uses the Bebop Drone and it's webcam to track an object in real time. The object is an ArUco code, the code uses linear moviments to maintain a predefined distance from the object.

## Important stuff
Ok, so this project happened a long time ago. My group and I were in a rush and after we finish it we all came back to Brazil. Now none of us have time or patience to setup the environment again to document it. Things I remember thought:
* It needs to run on Linux or Mac
* Needs OpenCV
* Use the CMake file to compile everything

## Contact me
In case you're working with the Bebop drone and using some sort of Machine Vision and are getting into trouble feel free to send me an email.
